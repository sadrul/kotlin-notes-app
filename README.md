# Kotlin Notes App

A modern Android application built with Kotlin that provides a comprehensive solution for managing multiple shopping lists and notes. This app demonstrates clean architecture principles, real-time data synchronization, and intuitive user interface design using Firebase Firestore as the backend database.

## Overview

The Kotlin Notes App is designed to help users organize their shopping lists and notes efficiently across multiple categories. Whether you're planning your weekly grocery shopping, organizing a party checklist, or managing daily tasks, this application provides a seamless experience with real-time synchronization across devices.

Built with modern Android development practices, the app leverages Firebase Firestore for cloud storage, ensuring your data is always accessible and synchronized. The application follows Material Design guidelines to provide a clean, intuitive user interface that feels native to the Android ecosystem.

## Features

### Core Functionality

**Multiple List Management**
The application allows users to create and manage multiple independent lists, each serving different purposes. Users can create separate lists for groceries, household items, work tasks, or any other categorization that suits their needs. Each list maintains its own set of items and can be customized with descriptive names.

**Comprehensive Item Operations**
Within each list, users have full control over their items with complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Items can be added quickly through an intuitive dialog interface, edited by long-pressing on existing items, and removed when no longer needed. The app also supports marking items as completed, providing visual feedback on task progress.

**Real-time Synchronization**
Powered by Firebase Firestore, all changes are synchronized in real-time across devices. This means users can start a shopping list on their phone and continue editing it on a tablet, with all changes appearing instantly. The real-time listeners ensure that the user interface stays updated without requiring manual refreshes.

**Intuitive User Interface**
The app follows Material Design principles with clean layouts, appropriate spacing, and intuitive navigation patterns. RecyclerViews provide smooth scrolling performance even with large lists, while dialog-based interactions keep the interface uncluttered and focused.

### Technical Features

**Cloud-First Architecture**
The application is built with a cloud-first approach, storing all data in Firebase Firestore. This NoSQL document database provides excellent scalability, real-time capabilities, and offline support. The data structure is optimized for efficient queries and minimal bandwidth usage.

**Offline Capability**
Firebase Firestore provides built-in offline support, allowing users to continue working with their lists even without an internet connection. Changes made offline are automatically synchronized when connectivity is restored, ensuring no data loss.

**Responsive Design**
The user interface adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, providing a consistent experience across various Android devices. The layout system ensures optimal use of available screen space while maintaining readability and usability.

## Usage

### Getting Started

Upon launching the app, users are presented with the main screen displaying all created lists. If this is the first time using the app, the screen will be empty, prompting users to create their first list.

### Creating Lists

To create a new list, tap the "Add List" button (typically represented by a floating action button with a plus icon). A dialog will appear asking for the list name. Enter a descriptive name such as "Grocery Shopping," "Weekend Tasks," or "Party Planning" and tap "Add" to create the list.

### Managing Lists

**Viewing Lists**: All created lists appear on the main screen in a scrollable format. Each list shows its name and can display a preview of contained items.

**Editing Lists**: Long-press on any list to access editing options. You can rename the list or delete it entirely. Deleting a list will also remove all items contained within it, so use this feature carefully.

**Accessing List Contents**: Tap on any list to open the detailed view where you can manage individual items.

### Working with Items

**Adding Items**: Within a list, use the "Add Item" button to create new entries. A dialog will prompt for the item name. Enter descriptive names like "Milk," "Call dentist," or "Buy birthday gift" and tap "Add."

**Editing Items**: Long-press on any item to access editing options. You can modify the item name or delete the item entirely.

**Completing Items**: Each item has a checkbox that can be tapped to mark it as completed. Completed items typically appear with a strikethrough effect or different visual styling to indicate their status.

**Organizing Items**: Items appear in the order they were added, with completed items often grouped separately for better organization.

### Best Practices

**Descriptive Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for both lists and items to make them easily identifiable.

**Regular Cleanup**: Periodically review and delete completed items or outdated lists to keep the app organized.

**Categorization**: Create separate lists for different categories of tasks or shopping needs to maintain organization.

## Project Structure

The application follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

```
app/
